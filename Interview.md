# Best answers interviewers usually like to hear

A strong answer often sounds like this:

“We use static analysis tools such as Cppcheck or PC-lint Plus to detect defects, undefined behavior, and coding-standard violations early, before runtime testing. In embedded projects, we typically integrate them with the build system, use the compile database for accuracy, review findings, suppress only justified cases, and track MISRA deviations formally.”
This aligns with the documented positioning of both tools around defects and compliance.
